        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>

          broaden it as much as possible throughout this course. </div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>I think I'm more of a programmer than designer because I'm not proficient at using various design programs
          such as Adobe Photoshop to create the layout and other visual elements of the website.</div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div>I think my learning outcome will be basic concepts of the World Wide Web, and the principles and tools that are used to develop Web applications.</div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you
          like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div>I'm confident in my independence and thoughtfulness which can prove to be beneficial when working alongside my partner.</div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
        <div>Facebook, Youtube, Twitch, Wikipedia, Reddit and Amazon.</div>
